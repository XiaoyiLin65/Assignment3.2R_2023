The function is designed to create random art. A random number as the argument 
can be used as a seed to draw reproducible results. 

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
make_art <- function(seed) {
  set.seed(seed)
  mydata <- runif(700,min = 0,max = 1)
  mydata2 <- rexp(700, 1)
  mydata3 <- mydata*pi
  plot(mydata2, mydata3, type = "l")
  }
```

For example, if the input is 123, then the output would be: 


```{r cars}
make_art <- function(seed) {
  set.seed(seed)
  mydata <- runif(700,min = 0,max = 1)
  mydata2 <- rexp(700, 1)
  mydata3 <- mydata*pi
  plot(mydata2, mydata3, type = "l")
  }
make_art(123)
```
if the input is 777, then the output would be


```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
make_art <- function(seed) {
  set.seed(seed)
  mydata <- runif(700,min = 0,max = 1)
  mydata2 <- rexp(700, 1)
  mydata3 <- mydata*pi
  plot(mydata2, mydata3, type = "l")
  }
make_art(777)
```
